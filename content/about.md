I’m Jack. I’m a musician and software developer based in Leicester in the UK. This is a blog about my creative projects. I write about [music](/posts/music), [software](/posts/software), and [life](/posts/life). I also post [reviews](/reviews) and [demos](/demos).

I am an avid writer but I don’t often post what I write. I love the idea behind [Show You Work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/about/) and will strive to present and demonstrate what I do. This website is an attempt at that.

You can see what I’m up to now on [my now page](/now). You can find more of me on the internet using [my links page](/links).

For my musical projects I use [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jackgutts) to upload demos. I release music on [Bandcamp](https://polarbites.bandcamp.com/) under the alias Polar Bites.

For my coding project I use [GitHub](https://github.com/jngutteridge) including to [host the code for this blog](https://github.com/jngutteridge/jack-website-2024). I sometimes work under the [Bespoke Media](https://www.bespokemedia.net/) brand for small businesses and organisations.

I’m active on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jng.me.uk) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackgutts/). You can also contact me by [email](mailto:jack@kingbrick.co.uk) or find me on one of my [other links](/links).
