I’m Jack. I’m a musician and software developer based in Leicester in the UK. This is a blog about my creative projects.

For my musical projects I use [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jackgutts) to upload demos. I release music on [Bandcamp](https://polarbites.bandcamp.com/) under the alias Polar Bites.

For my coding project I use [GitHub](https://github.com/jngutteridge) including to [host the code for this blog](https://github.com/jngutteridge/hugo-jackgutts-blog). I sometimes do work under the [Bespoke Media](https://www.bespokemedia.net/) brand for small businesses and orginisations.

I’m active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackgutts/), [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@jackgutts), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jackgutts). You can also contact me by [email](mailto:jack@kingbrick.co.uk).
