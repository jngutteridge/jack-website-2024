Sometime around late 2008 myself and Luke sat in my parents’ garage. I was inspired by the new wave of Vertigo of Bliss inspired bands around Leicester. I wanted to create an epic instrumental and then put some lyrics and melody to it.

I wrote the lyrics to match our recent teenage drama. There are seven questions in the song asked to my friend about a broken-down friendship group. It was all rather toxic.

Seven Questions was born.

The song became one of our go-to tracks when we wanted something to play. Later when Kev joined the band he added his amazing touch to it, which is lacking on this track because I’ve changed keys since we’ve last recorded.

Originally played and recorded in drop-D, I’ve no idea how we sang that high. Later I went through a phase of tuning our guitars down to drop-B, and it became easier to sing. Now I play it in standard tuning in the key of A. It sounds much better.

It also features a 7/8 verse, which was cool at the time but sits pretty naturally.

I love this song. I always have it in my repertoire after all these years.

[The lyrics can be found on the King Brick website](https://www.kingbrick.co.uk/01-brick-breaker/05-seven-questions/). I hope to release this in an altered form with the rest of the band in the Brick Breaker project.
