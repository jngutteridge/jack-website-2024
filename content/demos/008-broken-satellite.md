This song goes back to 2016. I was upset at the shift in dynamics with a friendship group and wanted things to go back to the way they were before. It’s a typical ask when one yearns for the past rather than looking forward.

I played it at a couple of open mics in Leicester back before I really knew the scene. I was introduced to a few events through the community at an Alpha course. The softer songs often went down better in the stripped down format. I’d want to play punk rock and aggressive music which didn’t really fit the moods of open mics.

The song is possibly a nod to Jamie Lenman’s ‘It’s Hard to be a Gentleman’ as I was devouring his album ‘Muscle Memory’ at the time. It’s a simple composition with a rising harmony over a major key. I used to play in drop-D but very recently adapted it to standard tuning. It also sounds good in drop-D with a capo on the second as there are some harmonics I can hit and I prefer the chord voicing. Ironically it’s easier to sing in E-major, whereas at the time I was singing everything a bit too high for my vocal range.

I chose the name “Amy” because I wasn’t close to anyone with that name at the time. Another very ironic choice. In earlier iterations it was often sang “matey”, which is an awful word to use in a song.

It’s a simple song with a very simple structure and harmony. It stays in one key and floats around the typical chords. I’ve had some good feedback about it. I aim to record a version in E-major to better suit my voice for my (still) upcoming second album ‘Connections’. I may add fake strings, synths, a piano, and a few guitar licks that I want to tease out. I may just keep it simple.
