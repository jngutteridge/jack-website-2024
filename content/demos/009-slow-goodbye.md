The album is nearly finished and this demo has been live for 8 months. I’ve only just written this post for it.

There are reasons for that. “Slow Goodbye” deals with one of the most profound and upsetting moments of my life and I’m sure the life of others. It deals with losing someone close. Sadly there are two tracks on this album that cover lost loved ones.

The lyrics are pretty self explanatory. I don’t want to discuss the details. I wrote a song I hope he’d enjoy. I’m happy with it as a kick-ass rock song. I’m trying to normalise life in doing so.
