- Living in Leicestershire with my beautiful girlfriend.

- Enjoying coding websites and blogging on this website.

## What I’m planning on doing

- Writing and recording music. It’s been slow progress given my recent house move so I haven’t been able to focus on creating music. I aim to finish recording my second album ‘Connections’ under the [Polar Bites](https://polarbites.bandcamp.com/) project.
- Reading more books. I read 6 books in 2023. I’ve just finished [The Chimp Paradox](https://profstevepeters.com/books/the-chimp-paradox-book/
) by [Professor Steve Peters](https://profstevepeters.com/about-professor-steve-peters/) but have yet to pick my next read. I’m a slow reader.
- Playing video games. I’ve been playing Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers on PC and SteamDeck. I started the Mass Effect remastered trilogy and have yet to get far.

This page is inspired by [The Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about) pioneered by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), brought to my attention from reading the websites of [Matt Brunt](https://brunty.me/now/) and [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/now/).
