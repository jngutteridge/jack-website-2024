- Living in Leicestershire with my beautiful girlfriend.
- Working remotely as a front-end developer.
- Attending open mics around Leicester, Hinckley and Loughborough.
- Enjoying coding websites and blogging on this website.

## What I’m planning

- Writing and recording music. It’s been slow progress as my interests have shifted towards playing at open mics and coding. I aim to finish recording my second album ‘Connections’ under the [Polar Bites](https://polarbites.bandcamp.com/) project.
- Reading more books. I read 6 books in 2023. I’m currently reading [The Yellow House: Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Nine Turbulent Weeks in Arles](https://www.martingayford.co.uk/books/the-yellow-house/) by [Martin Gayford](https://www.martingayford.co.uk/). I’m thoroughly enjoying it despite my pace. I’m a slow reader.
- Playing video games. I’ve been enjoying [Eastward](https://eastwardgame.com/) on the Steam Deck and [Command & Conquer Remastered](https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered) on PC. I have yet to progress far in either game. I think I got quite far in Command & Conquer in the 90s.
- Coding more apps. I’ve recently launched [Leicester Open Mics](https://www.leicesteropenmics.co.uk) and I’m looking at doing more for the local music community.

This page is inspired by [The Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about) pioneered by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), brought to my attention from reading the websites of [Matt Brunt](https://brunty.me/now/) and [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/now/).
