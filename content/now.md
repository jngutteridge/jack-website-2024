- Living in Leicestershire with my beautiful girlfriend
- Working remotely and leading projects as a front-end developer
- Attending and hosting open mics around Leicester, Hinckley and Loughborough
- Playing in my new function band [Everything In-between](https://www.everythinginbetween.uk/)
- Enjoying coding websites, apps, and writing for this website

## What I’m planning

- Writing and recording more music. I have almost finished recording my second album “Connections” and have recently [remastered and released my first album “Grief”](/posts/grief-by-polar-bites-remastered) under the Polar Bites project.
- Reading more books. I have recently finished “Feel Good Productivity” by Ali Abdaal. I have just started reading “A Million Miles in a Thousand Years” by Donald Miller.
- Playing video games. I’ve been enjoying playing the new “Doom: The Dark Ages” and and awesome metroidvania called “Nine Sols”.
- Designing video games. I have a few ideas and I’m currently working my way around the Godot game engine.
