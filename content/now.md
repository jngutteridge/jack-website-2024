- Living in Leicestershire with my beautiful fiancée Amy and our dog Izzy
- Working remotely and leading projects as a front-end developer
- Attending open mics around Leicester, Hinckley and Loughborough
- Playing in my new function band [Everything In-between](https://www.everythinginbetween.uk/)
- Playing as the live guitarist for [Amy Dx](https://www.facebook.com/amydxmusic/)
- Enjoying coding websites, apps, and writing for this website

## What I’m planning

- I have finished recording my second album “Connections” and it will be published in the coming weeks. I [remastered and released my first album “Grief”](http://localhost:5173/posts/grief-by-polar-bites-remastered) under the Polar Bites project.
- Reading more books. I have recently finished “Tiny Experiments” by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. I am searching for my next read.
- Playing video games. I’ve been enjoying playing “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” and the incredible “Deltarune”.
- Designing video games. I have a few ideas and I’m currently working my way around the Godot game engine.
- Making Doom levels. I have enjoyed playing and modding Doom since I was too young to play. Doom sparked my interest in coding. It feels good to be back.
