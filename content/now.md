- Living in Leicestershire with my beautiful girlfriend
- Working remotely and leading projects as a front-end developer
- Attending and hosting open mics around Leicester, Hinckley and Loughborough
- Enjoying coding websites, apps, and writing for this website

## What I’m planning

- Writing and recording more music. Life got in the way in 2023 but I’ve since picked up the audio interface and microphones. I am mostly finished recording my second album ‘Connections’ and plan to remaster my first album ‘Grief’ under the [Polar Bites](https://polarbites.bandcamp.com/) project.
- Reading more books. I have recently finished [The Yellow House by Martin Gayford](https://www.jng.me.uk/reviews/the-yellow-house/) and Sight of You by Holly Miller. I am currently flicking between books before settling on my next read.
- Playing video games. I’ve been enjoying playing the new Doom I + II and Sonic Frontiers. I’m getting close to becoming vaguely competent at it.
- Coding more apps. I’ve been updating [Leicester Open Mics](https://www.leicesteropenmics.co.uk) and am building a system to organise my lyrics so I can view them when I’m performing.
- Making levels in Doom. I have recently started building the Parcel Yard in Doom, a project to recreate a now demolished bar by Leicester’s train station.

This page is inspired by [The Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about) pioneered by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), brought to my attention from reading the websites of [Matt Brunt](https://brunty.me/now/) and [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/now/).
