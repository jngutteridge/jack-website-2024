Every third Thursday of the month I host an open mic at Leicester’s Parcel Yard. Last night was our March event and it was great to see so much talent and support.

It’s an informal event. The Parcel Yard is a great venue for music - a huge space and a friendly vibe.

The next one is on Thursday 20th April 2023. I’m looking forward to hosting regulars, new faces, and stragglers too!

[Sign up to the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1555109288319005/).

It would be lovely to see new faces. If you play or sing or enjoy great music, please come along.
