I am very happy that my house move which has dominated the majority of my 2023 is nearly done. It seems like a long time ago we had the idea to move. In January me and my girlfriend made the decision to start this project. Since then it’s been all go with admin and moving stuff.

There’s still a way to go. We’ve got lists of lists of things that need doing. Seeing us check something off it every day feels good and keeps us honest with our progress. Hopefully by the end of the year we can relax.

My project idea with King Brick didn’t work. I couldn’t get the time to learn the songs and direct the band. It’s sad but restarting it is something to look forward to in the future.

I’m looking forward to using my spare time to be idle. I’m looking forward to making music again. The list of things I’m looking forward to is near infinite.

That’s it for this time. Thanks for reading and I’ll catch you next time, hopefully writing from my new home studio and office.
