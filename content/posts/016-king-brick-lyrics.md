I’ve thrown up some old lyrics and put them on [a new website for King Brick](https://www.kingbrick.co.uk/).

King Brick are a noisy band and a project that I wish to revisit very soon. Although I have been saying this for ten years.

I was inspired to set the page up after one of our friends at an open mic tried Googling the lyrics myself and Luke were singing. It’s hard to tell if it’s a song by Biffy Clyro or me…

The website is incomplete and hopefully a restart of something that will go on. I registered the domain in 2007 (I think) and it’s been through a few iterations since then.
