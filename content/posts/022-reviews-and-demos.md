A few weeks ago I updated my website to include [reviews](/reviews). At the moment, only one review stands in each section: [Books](/reviews/book), [Music](/reviews/music) and [Live](/reviews/live). I’ll add more mediums as I write them up (I currently have a prompt for a game review).

Recently I’ve separated [demos](/demos) into their own section. I didn’t feel like they fit under the “posts” idiom especially now that I’ve extracted reviews into a bespoke section. I used to like the feel of everything being in a single feed similar to a social media timeline. The more I curate what I’ve written the more I feel it flows better to separate it.

I put off extracting the demos section because I felt it would be better to put them into a separate website altogether. I haven’t built a website specifically for my musical projects yet, so this makes sense as of now.

I’m still not confident in posting my creative work across its varied domains. I’m doing well posting demos (although I’m still behind in writing at least one of them up). I’ve also been working on websites and games but have yet to show my work there.

The same applies for my social accounts. I’m terrible at updating anything creative and non-personal. I have several Instagram accounts for my music and game development but they remain stale.

I still enjoy my time being creative. As I continue with this young website I hope to find a flow.
