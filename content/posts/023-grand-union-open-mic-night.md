Last month saw new owners take on the [Grand Union bar in Leicester](https://www.facebook.com/grandunionLeicester). I am now hosting the open mic nights there with Tasha as part of [our acoustic duo](https://www.facebook.com/jack.tasha.duo).

We ran our first event earlier in the month and it was a success with faces familiar and new turn up to perform and watch some of Leicester’s finest acts.

We run the open mic on the 2nd & 4th Thursday of the month. The schedule can be found on [Leicester Open Mics](https://www.leicesteropenmics.co.uk/events/grand-union/).

If you’re Leicester based and have a slight interest in music you can [join the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1926409147855054).

The Grand Union is a great venue run by friendly staff and is a great space for hosting music, food, and drinks. I adore my time at open mic nights. The community in Leicester and the surrounding villages is second to none.
