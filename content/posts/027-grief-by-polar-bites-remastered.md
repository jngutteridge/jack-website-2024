In October 2021 I released my album ‘Grief’ to Bandcamp. You can [read my write-up about it on this website](/posts/grief-by-polar-bites/). In my writing, I talk of remastering and releasing the album to streaming services “hopefully sometime later this year”. That was two years ago. I’ve got plenty of faults, but estimations are one of my biggest.

As my second album ‘Connections’ nears a finish I spent a few days taking the old versions of the songs from ‘Grief’, remixing and remastering them and putting them on streaming services.

You can [listen to ‘Grief’ by Polar Bites on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1g728BbivVLAw9mmluLY9z?si=443a7a5a598b463e).

It’s also on most other streaming services. Releasing an album was a process I wanted to be familiar with before I wanted to press go on the ‘Connections’ album. The process was smooth and I am happy with the results. The remixing process was fun and I was able to take what I’d learnt in the four years since and apply it. The songs now have more space and less aggressive compression.

Hopefully I can keep the momentum going and get the last parts of my second album finished in good time. I’m excited to share it all with the world.
