Van Gogh is famous for his self-mutilation and art. From episodes of Doctor Who to countless other cameos on TV, I had witnessed a patroyal of a man who suffered a very human condition. I can only hope his suffering was met with the joys of life. His visions captured in his work certainly point that way.

In September 2022 I travelled to Amsterdam with my girlfriend. It’s an incredible place and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. One of the attractions we visited was the Van Gogh Museum.

Van Gogh’s work left me stunned. From his self portraits to his luscious landscape views. Everything he committed to canvas was outstanding.

Art is a means of communication. Often that comes with emotion. Van Gogh’s dynamic works show a depth of humanity I had little experience of. A lot of joy and so much sadness.

Often it is thought that Van Gogh was colourblind, leading to his vast use of light and colour in his work. Another health condition it’s believed he had was of his mind. He experienced extreme moods from depression to madness. This gives the depth of his communication and his higher connection with emotion a greater meaning seen committed in his paintings.

I was hooked. I wanted to learn more about how this magnificent man lived.

Martin Gayford’s The Yellow House tells the story according to its subtitle, of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Nine Turbulent Weeks in Arles. The book carries a depth of a historian and art critic with thoroughly researched and opinionated accounts of Vincent through the letters with his brother Theo.

Having the two artists often capture the same scene together shows the contrast between Van Gogh and Gauguin, in their lives and their work.

I view Van Gogh as a celebration of those that are different. Whereas neurotypical folk can often suggest those with differences as less, Van Gogh is proof that they can be more.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Yellow House. Gayford’s writing is clear and not too dry. His understanding is deep and well researched. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the brilliant Van Gogh.
