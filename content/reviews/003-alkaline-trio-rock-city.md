It’s 2024 and we have new albums from Sum41, Alien Ant Farm, Green Day and Alkaline Trio. Pinch me, for I must have tripped and fell into a time machine.

I couldn’t get enough of these latest offerings. I had to see them live.

Alkaline Trio were supported by Lowlives, who were really really good. They were headline stuff. Their songs caught me and their noise punched me in the stomach.

A swift turnaround and we were greeted by the opener from the new album, sounding absolutely raucous.

Alkaline Trio played a great mix of old and new. Everything sounded fresh, fast and loud.

I couldn’t have asked for anything more from this incredible act.

A special shout has to go to the new tracks. “Bad Time” sounded amazing in person. “Versions of You”, “Break”, the list goes on. Long live this wave of pop punk rock!
