It’s 2024 yet the pop-punk revival of the early-00s continues. I am here for it.

Sum41’s latest album Heaven x Hell is incredible. Every song is a banger. It goes on a good while and all of that time is well spent.

The gig was back on 30 October 2024. I’m no stranger to Nottingham’s Motorpoint Arena. I saw Slipknot there back in 2009 and have attended many gigs there since. It’s a great and efficient venue. It’s also pretty vast.

Support came from LA punk rockers The Bronx, who I was familiar with. They played a blinder from start to finish with powerful, unstoppable, gritty rock. I was in love.

Sum41 were on in no time and from the first chord to the final (actual final) encore, there was nothing but celebration.

Sum41 are calling this a farewell tour. I refuse to believe it mostly because I don’t understand why such an awesome band would call it a day after releasing such good music.

But it’s their legacy that played the part here. I enjoyed the newer stuff thoroughly but their back catalogue shined. It’s difficult not to resonate with every song from their setlist. I remember the times and places where I heard these incredible sounds.

It was a fun gig. It was a sad gig. It’s a gig I’ll never forget.
