I hadn’t heard of Four Year Strong and I’m absolutely livid they were not on my radar. I was guided to their video for “Maybe It’s Me” by the YouTube algorithm. The song isn’t overly heavy, making use of acoustic guitar for its main riff. It uses an interesting chord progression, starting on the second chord in a major key.

Released in August 2024, “Analysis Paralysis” absolutely rocks. I was initially confused by the harsh and very heavy instrumentation throughout each song, mainly because each song is mostly in a major key. Turns out they’ve been doing this since 2007 according to their discography, with one track in that first album summing up my point succinctly, being titled “Beatdown in the Key of Happy”. This lends to a pop-punk vibe, but decorated with triads and borrowed chords from relative keys it’s a lot more complex, and almosts tricks the listener into a sense that this isn’t actually happy stuff. I tried to ironically analyse the music from track 10 of this album, “Rollercoaster”. There’s a lot going on, and it’s firing off in all sorts of keys. But it’s still mostly in a major key.

I’m almost a year late writing up this review. I sat for hours listening to this beautiful gritty piece and I enjoy revisiting it. They toured the UK including Rock City Nottingham in early 2025, but I was a bit gigged out by then. I regret not seeing them.

There are too many good tracks on this album to highlight. It’s cohesive and makes for a brilliant time. I am excited to have found this band that I absolutely resonate with.
