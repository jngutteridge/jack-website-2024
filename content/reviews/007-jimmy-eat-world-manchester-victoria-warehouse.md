It was over a year ago I attended this gig. I don’t know why I’ve slept on reviewing it for so long. One of the reasons could be because we attended so many gigs in 2024 and it exhausted me a bit, as brilliant as it was.

Jimmy Eat World need little explaining. They’re awesome and for damn good reason. Genre defying.

They played the Victoria Warehouse in Manchester on 14 November 2024. Pup supported and were a joy to hear live too. I’ve long enjoyed Pup. I thought they played 2000Tress in 2019 but I am mistaking them for Puppy. Similar vibes and comically me in mixing them up.

It was a glorious gig. Jimmy played for ages and every second was incredible. They don’t miss. Their songs are varied and dynamic. They’re an inspiration in my own writing.

I’d previously seen them supporting Frank Turner (with Leicester’s own Grace Petrie on the bill) in an arena in Brum. I’m sure I’ve seen them before that too, but I can’t recall. Maybe supporting Biffy?

Glorious band. Go and listen to them now!
