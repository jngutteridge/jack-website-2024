I finished reading The Sight of You by Holly Miller in October 2024. I had been slowly reading it throughout the years prior. It tells the tale of Joel and Callie underpinned by a supernatural element. The story is beautiful. The imagery flows and traverses the ups and downs of life, love and loss really well. As the story darts between pivotal events in the characters lives the theme of sacrifice becomes clear and it’s haunting to read.

I do consider the book to be overdone. Everything is rather extreme. This isn’t a bad thing. We read books to escape. If we wanted to be bored we’d watch Coronation Street.

These highs and lows along with the elements of supernatural do break the immersion for me. It’s hard to believe in a story like this. Regardless, the poiniency and deepness in every chapter does make for a gripping read. Great stuff for fans of romance.
