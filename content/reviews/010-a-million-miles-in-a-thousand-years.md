I had been recommended this book from watching self-help influencers rave about it. I read it in a few sittings and was absolutely gripped. I couldn’t put it down. This may not sound extraordinary but as someone with as poor concentration as mine, who only managed to read 3 books in 2025, it was basically a miracle.

Despite the great story I was tentative to continue after the start. It was overly cliche about a writer who was bored. The author obviously has done well and needed to find something else to do. He idolises himself.

That said this soup of stories was a great read. The concept is actually quite beautiful. I was put off by the lack of acknowledgement of the authors privilege but he obviously has talent when it comes to writing and storytelling. I laughed a lot and felt for him when we was down or idling.

A beautiful concept driven well. We should all strive to make and share stories. If we are in a rut we should change things if we are fortunate. It calls out for the reader to assess their own values. As someone who strives for calm and creativity it scared me thinking about disruption and adventure. It depends on the person but I’ve had enough excitement for now. It does make me think and question that though!
