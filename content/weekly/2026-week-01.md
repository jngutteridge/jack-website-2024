- I took the week off as annual leave to get through and over the festivities.
- We took Izzy to a local dog field with a friend. She recommended it as it is fenced off and open to the public. It was perfect to see her running around with our friend’s dog. Izzy was nowhere near fast enough to catch up with her new friend.
- I recorded [a quick snippet from one of my tracks “The Path to Better Things”](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS2THD7jPmD/). The song was written in 2023 and will feature in my upcoming album called “Connections”.
- Against my better judgement I bought a cheap tripod stand for my digital camcorder. I should’ve researched and bought a proper camera stand. Even a simple adapting screw for a sturdy tablet stand I already own would’ve been a better move.
- Did my annual back-up of my recordings and Doom levels. As I write this I realised I forgot to include the photos from my camera. I didn’t bother backing up any Godot projects or paintings as I haven’t made enough progress to justify the effort.
- We hosted a New Year’s Eve gathering including copious amounts of Duck Game, as it should be. We prepared far too much food and there was enough booze on the table to sink a small ship.
- I have continued reading Tiny Experiments and playing Clair Obscur.
