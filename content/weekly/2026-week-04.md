- Wrote up my website pieces for [A Million Miles in a Thousand Years book review](/reviews/a-million-miles-in-a-thousand-years/) and [my new Connections album announcement](/posts/connections-by-polar-bites/). I’m almost getting consistent with the website.
- New phone. I spent hours installing and transferring everything. I opted to go from scratch which is probably not the best idea. Everything I have is backed up to cloud services so it’s not too painful. Had to get the passport out for a few things.
- Continued teaching music theory to a friend.
- Took Izzy out to be joined with a local Golden Retriever in the area. They’ve met a few times and are best of friends by now. It’s great watching them chase each other and play.
- Registered and put up another website for an unannounced project. It’s just a placeholder for now.
- Rehearsed with [Everything In-Between](https://www.everythinginbetween.uk/) at [Rewind Studios](https://rewindrooms.co.uk/). It’d been a while but we mostly remembered what we do! Sounding great.
- Joined the Red Lion open mic in Sapcote hosted by [Altered Ego](https://www.instagram.com/wearealteredego/). A great time featuring the amazing Madison Blues. Very rarely someone else sings Biffy Clyro but this was one of those nights!
- Joined the [Countesthorpe Festival Chorus](https://www.countfestchorus.co.uk/) committee call to discuss the upcoming 25th event. The wheels are in motion! Took a few actions away. We’re a well oiled machine at this point.
- Ate at Frame in St Martin’s Square with Amy. Glorious food. I nearly burst. Followed by a lovely evening and catching a wicked band playing 60s/70s rock n’ roll.
- A wonderful afternoon in Desford with friends. Great company, great food.
- Had a lovely time at a birthday party for my young nephew. Great to see family and friends. Loved seeing the young un’s play together.
- The debut open mic for [Altered Ego](https://www.instagram.com/wearealteredego/) at The Railway in Countesthorpe. As usual they smashed it. A packed out pub with lots of familiar faces. A great evening.
