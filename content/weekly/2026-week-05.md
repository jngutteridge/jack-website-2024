- After a long wait after pre-ordering in November, my Retroid 6 portable game console arrived. I’ve owned the 4 and still have the 5. I chose to put the stick above the D-pad to compliment the original configuration so that I can easier play modern games with the enhanced processing power.
- Picked up a Helix Floor model (a guitar pedalboard modeller). It’s a well gigged unit that’s been going strong for 8 years. I’ve previously owned the HX Stomp which has similar internals but instead of being a small three button pedal it’s a full 12 button pedalboard with an expression pedal. It’s glorious and will take me awhile to get to grips with.
- Attended [AI Paired Programming at BJSS Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/devops-notts/events/312894215/) tech meetup with a friend. It was an inspiring talk. I use AI to code extensively at work but have shied away in my personal projects for ethical reasons. Seeing how able it now is but more importantly what it will always fail at opened a lot of discussion.
- Had a treadmill delivered. It took a lot of effort to prepare the room and set it up. It’s hefty! That was more than my exercise for the week. I have yet to use it.
- Lots of admin with tax deadlines and other bits to sort out. I spent a significant amount of time collecting documents for various things. I am now sick of the Gov.UK website (despite it being very good).
- Given the talk I attended earlier in the week I gave [Google’s Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) a go. I have a Gemini Pro plan with my phone purchase. This was a mistake as I’m now addicted to vibe coding. I have since built and deployed a feasible app, along with authentication and a database back-end, thanks to this inspiration.
- Attended the [Iliffe acoustic charity concert for the British Heart Foundation](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/whats-on/leicester/blaby-district-social-centre/the-iliffe-acoustic-band-presents-a-charity-concert-in-aid-of-the-british-heart-foundation/e-oggexj). It was a glorious evening with friends. We know [Liam & Sean](https://www.facebook.com/liamandseanacousticduo/) well from their shifts at open mics. [Baker & Crane](https://www.facebook.com/BakerandCrane) were sublime too! A lovely evening with fantastic music supported by great friends.
- Continued teaching music theory. I was treated to too much amazing food afterwards. Good times.
- Practised and rehearsed with [Amy Dx](https://www.amydx.uk/) and band. We’d had a couple of months off but it was good to remind ourselves we still sound awesome. Some new songs in the pipeline which I almost managed to remember.
- A beautiful evening in Desford with friends eating too much Mexican food. Lovely chats and great times.
- Took Izzy out to see Karol and the family again. They’re getting on very well (the dogs and the family). Enjoyed catching up with family at the New Inn in Enderby.
- Finished the week streaming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 with friends. I’m finally getting the hang of this game. I am now less prone to spoilers. During some frustration with perceived latency from the controller (over Bluetooth) I plugged it in. It did make a difference. I’ve ordered a dedicated wireless receiver for the Xbox controllers.
